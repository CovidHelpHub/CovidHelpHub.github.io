# About Our Submission
**Welcome to the future of pandemic response.**

CovidHelpHub is a Messenger bot ready to help you with all of your coronavirus needs.  

The CovidHelpHub bot is our solution to end pandemics faster. We saw how there were many underprivileged people who did  
not have access to coronavirus testing, so we thought of a way to implement quick and accessible testing. If you are shown to  
have symptoms of coronavirus, we will direct you to go to the hospital in order to minimize others contracting it. We decided to  
expand our bot with features such as crowd control. You will be able to see real time statistics of places. Therefore, you can  
plan how to go about your day with a lesser chance of contracting coronavirus. Our bot will also direct you to many helpful  
links, whether it be for monetary donations or equipment donations to help out your community.
